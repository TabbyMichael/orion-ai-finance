AI-Powered Insight Generation

This module is responsible for translating the quantitative results from the
`analyzer` module into qualitative, human-readable financial insights. It is
designed to interact with external AI/LLM services (like OpenAI's GPT) to
generate narrative-style advice and observations.

This is a placeholder for the insight generation logic. In a real implementation,
this module would contain functions such as:
- `generate_spending_summary_insight()`: To create a narrative summary of
  recent spending habits.
- `create_anomaly_alert_insight()`: To explain why a particular transaction
  was flagged as an anomaly.
- `suggest_budget_optimizations()`: To provide actionable advice based on
  identified spending patterns.
