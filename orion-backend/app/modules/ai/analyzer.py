Financial Data Analysis Engine

This module is responsible for the core data analysis and statistical modeling
that powers the AI features of the application. It contains functions for
performing calculations on transaction data to identify patterns, anomalies,
and trends.

This is a placeholder for the analysis logic. In a real implementation, this
module would contain functions such as:
- `detect_spending_anomalies()`: To identify unusual spending behavior.
- `calculate_category_trends()`: To determine if spending in a category is
  increasing or decreasing over time.
- `forecast_future_spending()`: To predict future expenses based on past data.
