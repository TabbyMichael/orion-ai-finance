General Utility Functions

This module provides common, reusable utility functions that can be used
across the application. These functions are designed to be generic and
not specific to any single business domain.

Examples of utilities that could be placed here include:
- Date and time formatting helpers.
- Data sanitization or transformation functions.
- Functions for generating unique identifiers.
